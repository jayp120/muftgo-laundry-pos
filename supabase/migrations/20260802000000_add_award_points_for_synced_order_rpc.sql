-- Atomic points-earning RPC, used by both the online order-creation path and
-- the offline sync worker. Replaces the previous client-driven
-- read-balance -> branch -> update/insert -> insert-transaction sequence,
-- which had an unguarded race: two concurrent completions for the same new
-- customer could both see "no existing points row" and both try to insert,
-- or double-credit an existing balance. Doing it as one plpgsql function
-- makes the whole sequence a single implicit transaction with an internal
-- compare-and-swap guard, so calling it twice for the same order (retry
-- after a dropped connection, two tabs syncing the same queued order) is a
-- safe no-op the second time rather than a double-credit.
